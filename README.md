# Description

This project showcases my ideas for the future of robotics. How we program the robots and how they will execute them. Robot programming will be fundemantally different relying mostly on end-to-end learning of skills using diffusion policies or some similar technology that generates trajectories. Datasets will be public. Users can choose a dataset to train their networks on or create their own dataset.
